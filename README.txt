The Verdi Historical Preservation Society:

The Verdi History Preservation Society, Inc. consists of local residents concerned with the preservation of the history of Verdi and the surrounding area. In 2002, with the support of the Verdi Community Library, we started collecting photographs and artifacts that pertain to Verdi. We now have 85 scrapbooks that contain photos and histories of some of the families of early Verdi and we are working to collect more information.
